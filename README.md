# Capstone-Project-Data-Analysis-using-Python
## 📊 Capstone Project: Data Analysis using Python & Pandas
## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing three separate datasets — Employee, Project, and Assignment. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy), the project demonstrates essential data analytics skills such as data wrangling, handling missing values, merging datasets, applying conditional logic, and summarizing insights through aggregated outputs.

## ⭐ Key Features
**✔️ 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Created structured dataframes and saved them as CSV files for modular processing.

Handled missing values in the Project dataset using a running average implemented with loops.

Performed string manipulation including splitting names and applying gender-based prefixes.

**✔️ 2. Data Transformation**

Updated designation levels based on project status and age conditions using conditional logic.

Filtered employee records based on string patterns (e.g., city names containing specific letters).

**✔️ 3. Data Integration**

Merged Employee and Project datasets using common keys.

Aggregated project costs per employee using groupby() to create a summary dataframe TotalProjCost.

**✔️ 4. Output Generation**

Produced clean, analysis-ready datasets.

Created final summary tables highlighting total project cost per employee.

Ensured reusable, modular workflow suitable for real-world analytics pipelines.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation and transformation

NumPy – Numeric operations and array handling

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

CSV Files – Input and output dataset handling

## 📌 Conclusion
